1.- I'm not a designer, However y would add some other color palette to the proyect.

2.- I'll Add a Navbar in the top of the app, so that we can navegate around all the application in case of more features.

3.- Finally, I'll add a login component to validate the user that is watching the emails.

PD: I don't have a greate skill designing, but thats my personal opinion
