Challenge Report of Daniel Calvillo Mancill from MÃ©xico

1.- I'm not an expert with css, so... while I was building the button and the datepicker, I struggled with the positioning of the datepickers.

2.- The mission 1 i completed in three days, I didn't worked all day, but i was working on it for 3 days. It's very funy for me to make a design made on a pdf and moving it to code.

3.- The process during the second mission was a little bit harder, I struggled building the Responsive Layout Component, I wasn't very sure of how to implement it.


It was a very nice challenge, I look forward for you to check it and give me some feedback on the features that i could improve.

Thank you for your time.
